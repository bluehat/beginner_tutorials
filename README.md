Lillian, I made this for you! This way I can update your scripts when you need updates, and you can also get use to github.

This system assumes your tutorials are using Python 2.7 If you are using a 3.1 tutorial system, I can change the scripts to fix it.

You can check your python version with the following command in your terminal
> python --version

A terminal is the black thing where you type white text. On some operating systems it is called a console.
